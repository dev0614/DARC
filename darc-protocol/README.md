# DARC Protocol

This is the core protocol for the DARC(Decentralized Autonomous Regulated Corporation) project.

## Installation

Since Hardhat does not support any package management tools except npm, you need to use npm only to install the dependencies.

To install all dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Compile

To compile the contracts, run the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

The compiled contracts will be stored in the `artifacts` directory.

## Test

To run the tests, run the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```
